<h1>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h1>
<p>Datasets with many features can pose challenges for machine learning. Adding features can result in sparser data points, offering less information because of the decreased distance between them, making it harder to distinguish between close and distant points. This phenomenon, is known as the curse of dimensionality. PCA is an unsupervised algorithm used to reduce dimensionality while retaining as much information as possible.</p>
<h2>Case Study</h2>
<p>In this case study we apply PCA algorithm from both sklearn library and pca package on the set of data log.</p>
